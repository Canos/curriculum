What are variables in JavaScript?
--------------------------------

Variables are useful to store values and use them on different parts of your code.

You can place data into these variables and then refer to the data simply by naming the variable.

There are three keywords used when declaring variable in Javascript, namely: `var`,`let`,`const`
They follow this pattern or syntax `var variableName = variableValue`.

- Example:
```
let myName = 'Anthony';
let my_number = 25;
const PI = 3.14
var city = "Madrid"
```
